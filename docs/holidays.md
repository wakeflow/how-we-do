# How we holiday

## Annual Leave
Everybody has annual leave of 25 days per year.

## Public Holidays
There are 8 public holidays per year in England and Wales. You can take these days off on the date of the actual public holiday or at any other point in the year. This gives you a total holiday allowance of 33 days per year. 

## Taking a holiday
To take a holiday you need to submit a request at least two weeks before your first day off to andi@wakeflow.io. 

If you want to take public holiday on the date of the public holiday, you do not need to submit a request in advance, but please let the team know nonetheless.

After the holiday request has been accepted the dates should be visible on the wakeflow holidays calender. The holiday calendar should have been shared with you and should be visible at https://calendar.google.com If it is not please contact contact@wakeflow.io to have it added.

## Carrying over holiday days to the next year
The holiday year runs between 1 January and 31 December. If at the of the year you have days left over, you can take up to 5 of them over into the next year. If you have more than 5 days of holiday left untaken, they will be lost.

If you have any questions around taking holidays, please email contact@wakeflow.io
