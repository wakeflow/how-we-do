# Firestore backups

We use a github action to regularly take backups of Firestore on the projects that make use of this database.

## Setup
1. Create a Google Storage Bucket, say with name: `gs://firestore-backups`
2. Create a service account that has the following roles:
```json
[1] Cloud Datastore Import Export Admin
[2] Storage Admin
```
3. Create a JSON key file for the service account
4. Use the command given below (replacing the path with the path to your downloaded keyfile) to get the base64 encoded keyfile from google cloud terminal
```
base64 path/to/your/downloaded/keyfile.json
```
5. Add the base64 encoded keyfile as a secret to the github repo. Call the secret `FIREBASE_BACKUP_GCLOUD_AUTH`
6. create the file `.github/workflows/firestore_backup.yml` in your repo
7. Copy the below contents into that file
8. Create a Pull Request
9. Once the PR is approved, a Firestore backup will be taken every night at 3am.

```

  schedule:
    - cron: "0 3 * * *"
