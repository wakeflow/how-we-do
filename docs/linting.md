# ESLint

When working as a team, using a linter ensures a shared style of coding. This helps everyone immediately get their bearings when looking at a colleague's latest work. 
We use eslint as our linter. 

Every codebase has a .eslintrc file that shares

You can find our default .eslintrc file on [our dofiles repo](https://github.com/wakeflow/dotfiles).

## Installation

To get started with ESLint, you can install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev
```
or

```bash
yarn add eslint --dev
```

### add our `.eslint.json` file to the root  dir and run this command

```bash
eslint . --fix
```
