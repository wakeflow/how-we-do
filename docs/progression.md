# Career Progression

## Timing

Every year there are two dates where we systematically review the whole team and consider every team member for promotion. These are:

- 31 March
- 31 September

Leading up to these dates we will collect feedback from clients and team members about your performance and consider whether a promotion has been earned. On these dates any promotions will be communicated. On average, developers should expect to be promoted every 12 to 18 months.

You can see the developer bands we have [here](/how-we-do/developer_bands.md)
