We only make the same mistake once. Then we study it, understand everything about it and know how to never make it again. We do a blameless postmortem to understand exactly how the undesirable result happened. We ask why five times.

We're not perfect, but as long as we keep learnng and getting better every day, we'll keep winning

Mission to be the technology partner of choice for all of our customers

We are never done learning. No matter what our level of experience, we can always find a better way to do something. We look for those ways and share them with our team. When someone asks us for something we don't do it for them, we show them how it's done.
