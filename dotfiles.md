# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files that are usually hidden with a filename like `.filename` - hence the name `dot` files.

At Wakeflow, we publish our dotfiles in the following repo: https://github.com/wakeflow/dotfiles

The dotfiles contain our best practices and tools to accelerate our workflows.
